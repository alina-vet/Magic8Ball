# Magic8Ball

A simple classic Magic 8 Ball app for iOS.

The user can just speak his question. Like a real ball, you need to shake the phone to get a response.
The application receives random responses by reference (JSON ).

In case of internet connection absence or request failure, application uses one of hardcoded answers.
The user can edit the answers himself in the settings screen.
